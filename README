Wrote compileOS.sh which compiles and links the bootloader and kernel, can be tested by either double clicking, or (preferably) running in terminal with ./compileOS.sh

Wrote a function printString that accepts a c-string and an integer. 
The integer's value determined whether the c-string was printed or displayed to the screen.
We then changed the printString function to an interrupt call.
This can be tested by changing cx in the interrupt call .
i.e,    interrupt(33,0,"Print to screen\0",0,0);
	interrupt(33,0,"Print to printer\0",1,0);

Added readString(char*)
takes input from console and stores in character array
interrupt(33,1,cstring,0,0);

Added writeInt(int)
takes a number, converts into a char array and prints to screen or printer
interrupt(33,1,2019,0,0);

Added readInt(*int)
invokes readString, stores string (backwards), reverses string, and then converts to an int
interrupt(33,1,&num,0,0);
