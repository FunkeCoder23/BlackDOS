Wrote compileOS.sh which compiles and links the bootloader and kernel, can be tested by either double clicking, or (preferably) running in terminal with ./compileOS.sh
Wrote a function printString that accepts a c-string and an integer. 
The integer's value determined whether the c-string was printed or displayed to the screen.
We then changed the printString function to an interrupt call.
This can be tested by changing cx in the interrupt call .
i.e,    interrupt(33,0,"Print to screen\0",0,0);
	interrupt(33,0,"Print to printer\0",1,0);
The interrupt handler will eventually handle all service calls, but is currently handling 
the printing to screen and printing to the printer.
This can be tested by changing ax to a value other than 1, which will throw a General Blackdos error to screen. Also shown when using interrupt calls above.
i.e, interrupt(33,1,0,0,0); // prints BDOS error
